  - Achieved 22.46% overall coverage with room for improvement

### Priority 4: Enhancement - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Add error boundaries**
  - Created `ErrorBoundary` component with user-friendly error handling
  - Integrated error boundaries at application and route levels
  - Added proper error logging and recovery mechanisms
  
- [x] **Implement performance monitoring**
  - Added Web Vitals monitoring for Core Web Vitals tracking
  - Implemented resource timing monitoring
  - Created comprehensive performance tracking utilities
  
- [x] **Add CI/CD pipeline**
  - Created GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and deployment
  - Configured security auditing in CI pipeline
  - Added build artifact management and deployment automation

- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline includes security checks

### Performance Monitoring
- ‚úÖ Core Web Vitals tracking implemented
- ‚úÖ Resource timing monitoring active
- ‚úÖ Navigation performance tracking enabled

## üîß ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS MADE

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive `SECURITY.md` with security guidelines
- Added implementation documentation for all changes
- Included deployment and maintenance instructions

### Build Optimization
- Optimized build scripts for different environments
- Added memory allocation configurations
- Configured source map generation options

### Code Quality
- Added TypeScript strict configurations
- Implemented proper error handling patterns
- Created reusable component architecture

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT READY

The application is now production-ready with:
- ‚úÖ Secure environment variable configuration
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring
- ‚úÖ Automated CI/CD pipeline
- ‚úÖ Security best practices implemented

## üìù NEXT STEPS (Optional Future Improvements)

1. **Increase test coverage** to 80%+ for better code quality assurance
2. **Implement TypeScript 5.x** when react-scripts adds support
3. **Upgrade to React Router v7** when stable and compatible
4. **Add integration tests** for end-to-end testing
5. **Implement advanced performance optimizations** (code splitting, lazy loading)

All priority recommendations have been successfully implemented and the application is secure, maintainable, and production-ready! üéâ
