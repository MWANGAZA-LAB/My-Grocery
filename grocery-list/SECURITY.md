# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the security improvements implemented in the My-Grocery application.

## üîí Environment Variables Security

### Changes Made
1. **Removed hardcoded secrets** from `src/firebase.ts`
2. **Added .env to .gitignore** to prevent secrets from being committed
3. **Updated .env.example** with proper security warnings

### Required Environment Variables
All Firebase configuration must be set via environment variables:

```bash
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
```

### Deployment Security
- **Development**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your values
- **Production**: Set environment variables in your deployment platform (Railway, Vercel, etc.)
- **CI/CD**: Use GitHub Secrets for secure builds

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Measures

### Error Boundaries
- Added `ErrorBoundary` component to catch and handle JavaScript errors gracefully
- Prevents application crashes from exposing sensitive information
- Provides user-friendly error messages

### Performance Monitoring
- Implemented Web Vitals monitoring for performance tracking
- Added resource timing monitoring
- Helps detect performance issues that could indicate security problems

## üö® Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All environment variables are set in production
- [ ] `.env` file is not committed to version control
- [ ] Firebase security rules are properly configured
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled for all production deployments
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) headers are configured

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Run `npm audit` regularly to check for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Monitor application logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Review Firebase authentication and database rules

## üîß Commands

### Security Audit
```bash
# Check for security vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix automatically fixable vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Force fix (use with caution)
npm audit fix --force
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests including security-related tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false
```

## üìã Firebase Security Rules

Ensure your Firebase security rules are properly configured:

```javascript
// Firestore Security Rules Example
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Shared grocery lists (implement proper sharing logic)
    match /lists/{listId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Deployment Security

### Railway Deployment
1. Set all environment variables in Railway dashboard
2. Enable HTTPS/SSL
3. Configure proper domain settings

### GitHub Actions Security
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- Never expose secrets in logs
- Use minimal permissions for actions

## üìû Incident Response

If a security issue is discovered:
1. **Immediate**: Rotate all Firebase API keys
2. **Check logs**: Review Firebase and application logs
3. **Update dependencies**: Run security updates
4. **Notify users**: If data may be compromised
5. **Document**: Record the incident and response
