# Railway Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Deploy to Railway

### Prerequisites
- Railway account (sign up at railway.app)
- GitHub repository with your code

### Option 1: Deploy via GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Connect Repository:**
   ```bash
   # Push your code to GitHub first
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Railway deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Railway:**
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Click "Deploy Now"

   - Choose your repository
   - Railway will auto-detect it as a Node.js project

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
   In Railway dashboard â†’ Variables tab, add:
   ```
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_bucket
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

### Option 2: Deploy via Railway CLI

1. **Install Railway CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login and Deploy:**
   ```bash
   railway login
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

### Build Process
